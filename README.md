# Choose-the-best-investment-business-by-Tableau

The criteria for selecting investment is combination of three : 
High revenue, Low expenses, Top growth Ranking
To identify which business represents the best investment, this dashboard will assist you.

The upper right quadrant contains the businesses we recommend - high revenue, low expenses and in top growing rank .

The x axis stands for revenue, starting from 0 at the left side.  
And, the y axis stands for expenses, starting from 0 at the top.

All the diamonds in the upper right quadrant stand for low expense and high revenue.
The red diamonds stands for top business by growth in 2015. You can choose top ‘n’ (like top 10) you want by clicking the slider(growth leader) here.
For instance in this dashboard, as you can see, the 5 red diamonds stand for 5 different businesses who have expenses less than $6M and revenue higher than $10M. They also are 5 of the top 10 growth in 2015 . 
If you point your mouse on each diamond, you will see detailed information about the business. These red diamonds might be your best investment choice in this scenario.
 
Feel free to change the cutoff values for revenue and expenses to find what you are interested in , simplely click the relative slider on up right corner in my website.[viewable here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/S35F3PPR7?:display_count=yes).
